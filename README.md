### Hi, I am Rasa 👋

Through my intensive studies in Data Analytics at Turing College, I have acquired a robust skill set in SQL, analytical methods, data visualization, and presentation techniques. Plenty of real-life industry projects, and personalized feedback from industry professionals, have equipped me with both technical proficiency and effective communication. I am excited about the opportunity to apply my knowledge and contribute to data-driven decision-making processes.

Previously, I held the position of Subject Matter Expert at Cognizant - a specialist in loan establishment processes, responsible for providing in-depth knowledge and guidance to the team leader and members. I have gained valuable experience with process improvements and documentation, quality monitoring, client communication, and problem-solving while managing day-to-day operational challenges. Additionally, I provided support to the team in resolving complex cases and acted as a mentor to both new hires and existing associates.
