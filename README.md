### Hi, I am Rasa ðŸ‘‹

Currently I am making a career switch into Data Analytics and finishing up Data Analytics course at Turing College.

Formerly I was working as Subject Matter Expert at Cognizant. Our team worked with loan establishment process for Oslo-based client. As SME I gained valuable experience with process improvements and documentation, communication with client and mentoring for both new hires and existing associates.
