### Hi, I am Rasa ðŸ‘‹

Currently I am making a career switch into Data Analytics and finishing up Data Analytics course at Turing College.

Formerly I was working as a Subject Matter Expert (team leader's right hand responsible for processes in a loan establisment team) at Cognizant. I have gained valuable experience with process improvements and documentation, quality monitoring, communication with clients, problem-solving while managing day to day issues, supporting the team with solving complex cases and mentoring for both new hires and existing associates.
