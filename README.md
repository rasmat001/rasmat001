### Hi, I am Rasa ðŸ‘‹

I am currently transitioning my career into the field of Data Analytics and nearing completion of the Data Analytics course at Turing College. 

Previously, I held the position of Subject Matter Expert at Cognizant - a specialist in loan establishment processes, responsible for providing in-depth knowledge and guidance to the team leader and members. I have gained valuable experience with process improvements and documentation, quality monitoring, client communication, and problem-solving while managing day-to-day operational challenges. Additionally, I provided support to the team in resolving complex cases and acted as a mentor to both new hires and existing associates.
